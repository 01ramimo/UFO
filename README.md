# UFO

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage that provides in-depth information on UFO sightings. In addition, the webpage contains a table with multiple filtered criteria for the users to access.
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the following were performed:
•         HTML to create the webpage
•         CSS to format the webpage
•         The webpage filters were controlled through JavaScript


### Result 

Depicted below is a display/layout of the website and on the left-hand side is a filterable search table. The search table contains multiple criteria such as date, city, state etc thus allowing the end user to perform different searches according to their interests and preferences. Multiple filters can also be applied at the same time to drill down even further into the data.

### Summary

This webpage is user friendly with the multiple criteria search filter, which is important, however, there are a couple of drawbacks such as validation of the sightings. Hence, a recommendation to help improve the website would be as follows:

1.	To help with validation of the UFO sightings, a dichotomous question should be added to the webpage asking the webpage visitor the following: “Have you personally witnessed a UFO? “yes” or “no”.

2.	Have data that includes the number of people with the same sighting.

3.	Add a drop-down menu for some filters such as the comment section for more specificity.
